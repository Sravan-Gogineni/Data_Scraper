This combined degree program is for undergraduate students who are interested in pursuing a career in health care and becoming a physician assistant. Physician assistants (PAs) are highly sought-after health care providers who practice medicine as members of a health care team with supervising physicians. PAs diagnose illnesses, develop and manage treatment plans, prescribe medications, and often serve as a patient's principal health care provider. With increasing demand for health care services, the need for PAs will continue to grow as they are integral members of today’s patient-centered health care teams. With a strong clinical focus, this accelerated BS/MS program allows you to earn both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in just five years, rather than the six or more years it would take to earn the degrees separately. After earning a BS in biomedical sciences, you'll matriculate into the master’s program for a rigorous course of study in clinical medicine, research, and professional practice. Throughout the program, you'll gain extensive hands-on experience in a variety of clinical settings and develop the skills to be a compassionate, ethical, and knowledgeable health care provider.",
