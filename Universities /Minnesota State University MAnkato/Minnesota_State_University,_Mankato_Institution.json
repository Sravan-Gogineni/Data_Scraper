While some external sources suggest that recommendations may be considered if submitted, they are not a mandatory part of the application for general admission.\n\nGraduate Programs:\n\nFor graduate programs, the requirement for letters of recommendation is determined by each individual program. There is no single university-wide policy on the number of recommendations needed. Prospective graduate students should consult the specific admission requirements for the program they are interested in.\n\nFor example, the Master of Science in Elementary Teaching program requires two letters of recommendation. The graduate program in Geography requires applicants to submit three letters of recommendation from individuals familiar with their undergraduate academic performance.

These are most common in health-related fields and other specialized areas. For instance:\n\n*   Dental Hygiene: Applicants to the Dental Hygiene program may be required to submit observation hours in a dental setting, letters of recommendation, and a personal essay detailing their interest in the field.\n*   Nursing: The School of Nursing often requires a separate application, a personal statement, and sometimes an interview. Specific prerequisite coursework with minimum grade requirements is also a key component.\n*   Aviation: The Aviation program typically has additional requirements such as a flight physical (FAA Medical Certificate) and potentially an interview or essay related to the applicant's aviation goals.\n\nProspective students are advised to consult the specific departmental or program pages on the official university website (mnsu.edu) for detailed and up-to-date information on these additional requirements.\n\nConditional Admission:\n\nIn some cases, Minnesota State University, Mankato may offer \"conditional admission\" to applicants who do not meet all of the standard admission criteria.
