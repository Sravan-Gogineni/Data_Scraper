        "is_gmat_required": "True.\n\nWhile a GMAT or GRE score is not required for all graduate programs at California State University, Long Beach, it is a requirement for admission into certain programs. Therefore, the statement that the GMAT is required for the university is true in the context of specific graduate school applicants.\n\nFor instance, the Evening MBA program and the Master of Science in Marketing Analytics program, both within the College of Business, explicitly state that a GMAT or GRE score is required for admission, although waivers are available for applicants who meet certain criteria. The Master of Science in Information Systems program, however, does not list the GMAT as a requirement.\n\n**Evidence:**\n\nThe GMAT/GRE requirement is explicitly mentioned on the webpages for specific graduate programs within the College of Business at California State University, Long Beach. While a direct link to a single page stating a university-wide requirement is not available because the requirement is program-dependent, the program-specific pages serve as evidence that the GMAT is a requirement for certain fields of study at the university. Interested applicants should consult the admission requirements for their specific program of interest on the official university website, www.csulb.edu.",
