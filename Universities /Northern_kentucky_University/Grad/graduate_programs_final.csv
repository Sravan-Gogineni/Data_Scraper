The I-O psychology program is a full-time program with a fall admission only. All classes are held in the evenings to accommodate both traditional students and students who wish to maintain full-time employment while completing their degree. The typical student enrolled full-time will complete the program in two years. I-O psychology is the scientific study of the workplace and the application of psychological principles to workplace issues. I-O psychologists are scientist-practitioners who are trained to be competent in both research and application. They use the scientific method to better understand human behavior at work, and then they apply that knowledge to real-world organizational problems. I-O psychologists focus on a wide variety of issues. For example, I-O psychologists help organizations hire qualified and suitable employees, train and develop employees, manage and appraise employee performance, ensure fair and equitable treatment of employees, create and implement effective organizational development and change interventions, and promote employee health, safety, and well-being. The I-O psychology program at NKU provides students with a comprehensive understanding of I-O psychology theories, methods, and research.
