Students enrolled in the ATM program on the Daytona Beach Campus are required to participate in the FAA Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative (AT-CTI) program and pass the Air Traffic Skills Assessment (ATSA) exam to qualify for the program. This program is offered to U.S. citizens only. Students will acquire the skills necessary to pursue a career in air traffic control through hands-on simulations, a focus on current policies and practices, and an understanding of regulations that apply to the field. Upon graduation, students will receive an AT-CTI certificate allowing them to bypass the initial FAA Air Traffic Controller (ATC) Academy training phase and apply directly for ATC positions, given they meet all other FAA hiring criteria.

With an A.S. in Air Traffic Management from Embry-Riddle, graduates are prepared to enter a rapidly expanding field, one that offers exciting opportunities. Air traffic controllers are responsible for ensuring the safe and efficient movement of aircraft within controlled airspace. This includes issuing clearances, providing traffic advisories, and coordinating with other air traffic control facilities. The Air Traffic Management program at Embry-Riddle prepares students to meet the demand in this field by providing skills and knowledge in areas such as:
* Air Traffic Control Procedures
* Air Traffic Management Operations
* Airport Operations
* Aviation Weather
* Aviation Safety",,https://erau.edu/degrees/associate/air-traffic-management,,,"$1,707 per credit hour",,,,4.0,3.0,65%,,,,,,,,,,"$20,484 per semester",,,,,,,,,,,105.0,112.0,,,6.0,,,53.0,,79.0,,,,,,,,,,,"$4,000 - $18,000 per year",,Merit-based,,,,,,,
