Students will have opportunities to enhance their Spanish language skills through coursework ranging from intermediate to advanced levels, and to explore theories and practices of language teaching and learning. The program also encourages students to think about how their learning can be applied to real-world issues, including service learning and internships with organizations working with Latinx communities.

El Camino is an excellent choice for students interested in pursuing careers in education (especially bilingual education), social work, community organizing, public policy, translation, international development, and cultural resource management.
