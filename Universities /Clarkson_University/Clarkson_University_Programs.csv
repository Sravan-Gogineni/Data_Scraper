The undergraduate program in computational and applied mathematics is focused on providing students with a deep understanding of mathematical concepts and their applications, as well as the ability to use computational tools to analyze and solve complex problems. Students will learn how to:
*   Formulate mathematical models of real-world phenomena.
*   Analyze and solve these models using analytical and numerical methods.
*   Implement computational algorithms to simulate and analyze complex systems.
*   Interpret and communicate the results of their analyses effectively.
The curriculum covers a broad range of topics, including numerical analysis, optimization, differential equations, statistics, data science and machine learning. Students also have the opportunity to specialize in areas of interest through elective courses.",,https://www.clarkson.edu/academics/majors-minors,,,"$2,037",,,,4.0,2.0,68%,,,,,,,,,,"$61,096/Year",,,,,,,,,,,115.0,112.0,,,6.5,,,56.0,,80.0,,,,,,,,,,,"$20,000 - $40,000 per year",,Merit-based,,,,,,,
