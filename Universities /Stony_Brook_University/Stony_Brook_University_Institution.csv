The official Stony Brook University website states, ""The GRE General Test is required by several Graduate School programs. Please refer to the admissions requirement information about your specific program of interest"". This indicates that GRE requirements are determined by individual programs and are not universally required for all programs for international students. For example, for the Spring 2026 and Fall 2026 admission cycles, the GRE is not required for any PhD applicants in Computer Science, but it is required for international MS applicants to that program who do not have a post-secondary degree from the United States or Canada. Conversely, the GRE is waived for the Spring & Fall 2025 admission cycle for the Materials Science and Chemical Engineering department.
