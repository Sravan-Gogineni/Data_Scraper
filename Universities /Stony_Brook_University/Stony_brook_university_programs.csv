While students generally concentrate in a chosen field or medium, such as painting, drawing, sculpture, printmaking, photography, video, electronic media, installation, and performance art, a major emphasis of the program is on the crossing of these boundaries, and on the cross-pollination of ideas and methods. MFA students in the Department of Art also have the opportunity to participate in interdisciplinary study in other departments of the University. This is a 60 credit hour program that emphasizes extensive studio experience in the practice of art. The program also provides opportunities for study in the theory, criticism, and history of art. All graduate students are provided with individual studios. Studio visits are conducted regularly by the full-time faculty and by visiting artists and critics.

We provide a rigorous training program in the traditional areas of chemistry, as well as in a number of interdisciplinary areas. Our students graduate with a broad understanding of the chemical sciences, a deep knowledge in a particular research area, and the skills to succeed as independent scientists. The goal of the program is to bring each student to a level of knowledge and experimental or theoretical skill that will permit them, by the end of their program, to undertake significant research on their own. Students will take a number of graduate courses and will be required to pass a series of qualifying examinations. The major emphasis of the program is on research and the submission of an original and significant thesis is the highlight of the program. We offer students a choice of research opportunities in a wide range of areas that span the traditional disciplines of chemistry as well as interdisciplinary areas that include biological, materials, and physical sciences.

A Ph.D. is granted to a student who has fulfilled the course requirements and has completed a dissertation that makes a significant and original contribution to the body of knowledge in their chosen field of specialization. Both theoretical and observational studies are stressed. There are two major tracks of study: meteorology and physical oceanography. The meteorology track includes studies of atmospheric dynamics, atmospheric chemistry and radiation, and cloud and precipitation physics. The physical oceanography track is concerned with the study of the physics of the ocean, including ocean circulation, ocean-atmosphere interaction, coastal oceanography and sediment transport. In both tracks, the use of numerical models and state-of-the-art instrumentation form an essential component of the graduate education experience. SoMAS has a strong program in tropical meteorology. On-campus facilities include a computing cluster and meteorological instrumentation. Students and faculty have access to research aircraft and ships, and to radar and other remote sensing facilities. Students also can participate in a wide variety of field programs on a worldwide basis. There are many opportunities to develop interdisciplinary research programs with faculty in other fields, such as chemistry and engineering.
