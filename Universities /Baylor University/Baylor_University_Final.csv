Although a student’s interests typically fall within one of the primary areas of research, all graduate students develop a strong general background in psychology that is reflected in the Ph.D. in Psychology. We strive for a student-faculty ratio (typically 2:1) that is optimal for providing individualized instruction in small classes, seminars, and research laboratories. As a result, admission to our program is highly competitive. During the most recent admissions cycle we admitted 12 new Ph.D. students and 12 new Psy.D. students. All doctoral students who are in good academic standing are supported by a full tuition waiver and a competitive stipend for five years. More than half of our doctoral students are also supported by a prestigious University Graduate Fellowship.
