Within this flexible structure, students are encouraged to develop their own individualized course of study, working with their advisors to combine the available resources of the Department and the University in a way that best suits their particular interests and goals. The MFA is offered in two tracks: Studio Art and the IMAP (Integrated Media Art and Practice) program. While students generally concentrate in a chosen field or medium, such as painting, drawing, sculpture, printmaking, photography, video, electronic media, installation, and performance art, a major emphasis of the program is on the crossing of these boundaries, and on the cross-pollination of ideas and methods. MFA students in the Department of Art also have the opportunity to participate in interdisciplinary study in other departments of the University. This is a 60 credit hour program that emphasizes extensive studio experience in the practice of art. The program also provides opportunities for study in the theory, criticism, and history of art. All graduate students are provided with individual studios. Studio visits are conducted regularly by the full-time faculty and by visiting artists and critics. The Visiting Artist Program brings to campus a diverse and distinguished group of artists, critics, and art historians each semester for lectures, studio visits, and seminars. Art students may choose to supplement their studies with a range of art history, theory, and criticism courses within the Department of Art. In addition to our faculty, graduate students have access to the resources of a major research university, including extensive libraries and computer-imaging facilities.

We offer a full range of degree programs in chemistry, with Ph.D. degrees in Chemical Physics and Chemistry.

The PhD program in chemistry is focused on preparing students for a variety of careers in academia, industry, and government. We provide a rigorous training program in the traditional areas of chemistry, as well as in a number of interdisciplinary areas. Our students graduate with a broad understanding of the chemical sciences, a deep knowledge in a particular research area, and the skills to succeed as independent scientists. The goal of the program is to bring each student to a level of knowledge and experimental or theoretical skill that will permit them, by the end of their program, to undertake significant research on their own. Students will take a number of graduate courses and will be required to pass a series of qualifying examinations.

A Ph.D. is granted to a student who has fulfilled the course requirements and has completed a dissertation that makes a significant and original contribution to the body of knowledge in their chosen field of specialization. Both theoretical and observational studies are stressed. There are two major tracks of study: meteorology and physical oceanography. The meteorology track includes studies of atmospheric dynamics, atmospheric chemistry and radiation, and cloud and precipitation physics. The physical oceanography track is concerned with the study of the physics of the ocean, including ocean circulation, ocean-atmosphere interaction, coastal oceanography and sediment transport. In both tracks, the use of numerical models and state-of-the-art instrumentation form an essential component of the graduate education experience. SoMAS has a strong program in tropical meteorology. On-campus facilities include a computing cluster and meteorological instrumentation. Students and faculty have access to research aircraft and ships, and to radar and other remote sensing facilities. Students also can participate in a wide variety of field programs on a worldwide basis. There are many opportunities to develop interdisciplinary research programs with faculty in other fields, such as chemistry and engineering.
