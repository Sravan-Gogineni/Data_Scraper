Our program is a hybrid online and on-campus program, meaning some of the classes are available to be taken at home, with a few weekly lab sessions on-campus. Students in our Medical Billing & Coding Specialist program learn to identify the information needed to support diagnoses, procedures, and services, and correctly assign appropriate codes. Courses in the Medical Billing & Coding Specialist program include medical terminology, anatomy and physiology, electronic health records, professional medical coding, and more. Additionally, students receive training in front-office and back-office skills to prepare them for a variety of work environments. Medical billers and coders are key members of the medical revenue cycle team and are responsible for ensuring healthcare providers are accurately reimbursed for services provided to patients. Medical billing and coding specialists play a vital role in medical offices by translating the care a patient receives into billable codes, which are then used to submit claims to insurance companies. Without them, doctors and other medical professionals wouldn't get paid. As such, the demand for qualified medical billing and coding specialists is consistently high, leading to excellent job prospects for graduates.",,https://aimseducation.edu/programs,,,,FALSE,False,,4.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"up to $2,000",,Institutional,FALSE,,,FALSE,FALSE,,,False
