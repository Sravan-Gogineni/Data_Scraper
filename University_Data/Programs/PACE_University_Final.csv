Civil engineers design, build, supervise, operate and maintain infrastructure projects and systems in the public and private sectors. These projects include roads, buildings, airports, tunnels, dams, bridges, and systems for water supply and sewage treatment.

Civil engineering is traditionally divided into several sub-disciplines including environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, transportation engineering, municipal or urban engineering, water resources engineering, materials engineering, coastal engineering, surveying, and construction engineering. Civil engineers typically work in the areas of design, construction, research and teaching, or management.

The civil engineering curriculum provides students with a broad and solid foundation in the fundamental areas of civil engineering. Students learn about sustainable design, construction materials, and the use of technology and computers to solve engineering problems. In the senior year, students complete a capstone design project that integrates their knowledge from various courses.
