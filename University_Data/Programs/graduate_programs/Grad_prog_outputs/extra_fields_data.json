This innovative program is designed to serve the needs of individuals who are employed in the public and private sectors (e.g., industry, government and education) and whose careers require advanced training in biochemistry and molecular biology. The executive Ph.D. is a non-thesis, non-research degree. The program is offered via distance education with only a one-week, on-campus session required each summer. Most students complete the program in four to five years.",

We offer a Master of Science (M.S.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Biology. Graduate students have the opportunity to work with over 35 faculty members in four broad areas of emphasis: ecology and evolutionary biology, cellular and molecular biology and genetics, physiological biology, and microbiology. Many of our faculty also participate in interdisciplinary graduate degree programs, such as Genetics, Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (MCDV), and Pathobiology. The Division of Biology has an excellent record of training graduate students who are highly competitive and successful in a wide variety of careers in academia, government, and industry.",

Students may choose to conduct research in any of the primary research areas represented in the division. In consultation with the supervisory committee, a student develops a program of study that includes a minimum of 90 graduate credit hours. The supervisory committee determines whether a student’s prior work is acceptable for graduate credit. A typical PhD program will include formal coursework, research, dissertation, teaching, and seminars. Students will conduct research under the direction of a major professor within the Division of Biology. All students are required to participate in teaching, typically as a graduate teaching assistant.",
