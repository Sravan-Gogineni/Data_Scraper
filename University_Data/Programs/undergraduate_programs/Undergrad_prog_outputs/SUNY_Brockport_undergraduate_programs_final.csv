Both degrees provide an excellent preparation for graduate study.

The BA in Meteorology is more general and allows for greater flexibility in course selection, making it an ideal option for students interested in interdisciplinary studies or combining meteorology with other fields like journalism, public relations, or education. It requires fewer math and science courses than the BS degree, making it accessible to students with a broader range of academic backgrounds.

The BS in Meteorology is designed for students seeking a more intensive and rigorous scientific education. It includes a stronger emphasis on mathematics, physics, and computer programming, preparing students for careers in operational meteorology, research, and for graduate studies in atmospheric science. This degree meets the requirements for federal government employment as a meteorologist (GS-1340 series) with the National Weather Service, the military, and other agencies.

Both degrees include core courses in synoptic meteorology, physical meteorology, atmospheric dynamics, and atmospheric thermodynamics. Students gain hands-on experience with modern meteorological instrumentation, data analysis techniques, and forecasting tools. The program culminates in a capstone experience, such as an internship, research project, or senior thesis, allowing students to apply their knowledge to real-world problems.

Our faculty are dedicated educators and researchers with expertise in various areas of atmospheric science, including severe weather, climate change, air quality, and atmospheric modeling. They provide personalized mentorship and opportunities for student involvement in research.
