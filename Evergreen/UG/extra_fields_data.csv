How do authors use language and imagery to create meaning? How do literary works engage with social issues such as race, class, gender, and environmental justice? What roles do writers and literature play in society?",https://www.evergreen.edu/programs/literature,,Literature,https://www.evergreen.edu/registration/degree-requirements,
